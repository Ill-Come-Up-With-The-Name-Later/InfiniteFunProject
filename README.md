Minecraft Version: 1.21 PaperMC
- To run this, you will need a 1.21 Minecraft server running PaperMC

- If I'm being honest, I could never truly mention everything I've added here. IF you want to see what's been added, just download the plugin from the releases and see for yourself. This is just a small snippet I think.

<p>
This plugin is practically a sort of "expansion" onto Minecraft's standard difficulty. It adds a lot of custom items and abilities as well as significantly increasing enemy power levels as time passes. Every 240 seconds, a random event
will occur, and there are around 20 random possibe events and another dozen or so rarer events called anomalies. In addition to random events every 4 minutes, a random modifier is selected every 480 seconds that lasts until the next one
is chosen. There is even the chance for up to two bonus modifiers to be applied on top of the first choice.

<p>
Players have to now worry about thirst, heat, and cold, which are affected by the current state of the player and can even change with the player's current biome.
</p>

<p>
Player combat has receieved some questionable changes: from making shields give a flat damage resistance to adding Team Fortress 2 styled randomized critical hits, to even adding the ability for a player's attack to hit twice.
</p>

<p>
Players can also spend XP levels to upgrade their stats such as damage, health, and reach. There are also special challenge modifiers that cannot be removed once activated.
</p>

<p>
In addition to improvements to regular enemies and making things just more inconveient, the Ender Dragon and Wither have recieved buffs to their health and attacks, and they have gained new attacks to add to their arsenal.
